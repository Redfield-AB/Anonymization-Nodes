        <intro>
        	Two types of risks are considered:
        	<ol>
        		<li>
        			combinations of quasi-identifiers that can be analyzed regarding associated risks of re-identification;<br></br><br></br>
					The view provides information about the degree to which combinations of variables separate the records from each other and to which degree the variables make records distinct.

        		</li>
        		<li>
        			estimations for three different attacker models:
        			<br/><br/>1) The risk that a specific person in the dataset can be re-identified when the attacker knows they are in the dataset. (The “prosecutor scenario.”)
					<br/><br/>2) The risk that there exists at least one person in the dataset who can be re-identified. The point is to prove that someone can be re-identified. In this case, the goal of the re- identification is frequently to embarrass or discredit the organization that performed the de-identification. (The “journalist scenario.25”)
					<br/><br/>3)  The percentage of identities in the dataset that can be correctly re-identified. (The “marketer scenario.”) <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8053">Mode Details</a>						
        		</li>
        	</ol>
			If two tables are provided then, additional columns are shown in the output tables.
